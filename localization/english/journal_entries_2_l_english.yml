je_kor_terakoya:0 "Korean Church Schools"
je_kor_terakoya_reason:0 "Inspired by the Japanese model, Terakoja schools are beginning to emerge in Korea as small, community-run educational institutions offering basic literacy and numeracy training. Originally rooted in Buddhist temples, these schools are gaining importance as they provide education to the lower classes—groups historically excluded from formal learning. Beyond reading and writing, Terakoja schools often teach moral values, typically grounded in Confucian thought. In rural areas, local scholars, monks, or literate citizens take on the role of teachers. This grassroots educational movement could transform Korean society by empowering broader segments of the population to participate in economic and political life. However, it may also create friction with conservative elites resistant to change."

je_great_polish_revolt:0 "The Rebirth of Poland"
je_great_polish_revolt_reason:0 "For decades, Poland has languished under foreign domination—its lands partitioned, its people suppressed, and its national spirit trampled beneath imperial boots. Yet in the hearts of Poles, the dream of independence never died. Now, that dream begins to burn again. From Warsaw to Kraków, whispers of rebellion become open cries for freedom. Secret societies organize, exiled nobles return, and students raise banners bearing the white eagle. Russian garrisons grow restless as reports of sabotage and unrest spread. The Polish people are preparing to cast off the yoke of Russian oppression and restore their nation to its rightful place among the free. Should this flame of resistance catch wind, it could ignite a firestorm across Eastern Europe—one that neither empire nor tsar can easily extinguish."

je_great_polish_revolt_2:0 "Destiny of Poland"
je_great_polish_revolt_2_reason:0 "Poland has returned—not as a victim of history, but as a force within it. The age of partitions is over, and the Polish nation has reclaimed its rightful place among the powers of Europe. But our gaze is not fixed on the past; it is set firmly on the future—and that future lies to the East. From the fertile plains of Ukraine to the ancient cities of Lithuania and Ruthenia, these lands are bound to us by history, culture, and legacy. Once united under the crown of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, they now await the return of Polish stewardship. Not as conquered provinces, but as integral parts of a renewed Polish order. It is our destiny—nasz los—to bring order where there is chaos, culture where there is barbarism, and to raise the Polish banner once more over lands where it once flew with pride. The East is calling—and Poland will answer."
